The application works with API of the weather site. It sends a request with certain settings to the website http://api.openweathermap.org  and receives JSON file. Then it parses file and creates a list with the weather forecast for 5 days in certain region. Units and region can be changed in the settings. 
Application works with the Google-map and displays geo-location.
